# Falling word
### Documentation:
  I faced an issue with setting up the UI tests, if I had more time maybe I could've made it work<br/>
  With more time i could make it a multi-language game and possibly add levels<br/>
  I could've also added sound effects to it<br/>
### Game flow:
  Once you press Start button you'll be moved to the gaming screen where you will see the english word still and the spanish word moving.<br/>
  In the top left corner you will see the timer going (10 seconds) and next to it your high score and beneath them your current score.<br/>
  Down the screen you will see two buttons. Correct, you press it when the spanish word is the correct translation for the english word.<br/>
  The incorrect button, you press it when the spanish word is not the correct translation for the english word.<br/>
  You will lose either by choosing wrongly or by the time given to you ending.
### Tools:
  Used RxJava<br/>
  Used Dagger<br/>
  Used JetPack components<br/>
  Used retrofit for networking<br/>
  Used mockitokotlin2 alongside with JUnit for unit testing<br/>
### Architecture:
  Used MVVM
